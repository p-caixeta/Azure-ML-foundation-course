# Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

This lesson covered two of Machine Learning's fundamental approaches: **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning.

## Main topics:

**Supervised learning**

- More about classification and regression, two of the most representative supervised learning tasks
- Some of the major algorithms involved in supervised learning, as well as how to evaluate and compare their performance
- How to use the Designer in Azure Machine Learning Studio to build pipelines that train and compare the performance of both binary and multi-class classifiers.
- How to use automated machine learning to automate the training and selection of classifiers and regressors, and how to use the Designer in Azure Machine Learning Studio to create automated Machine Learning experiments

**Unsupervised learning**

- the main feature: clustering
- How unsupervised learning can address challenges like lack of labeled data, the curse of dimensionality, overfitting, feature engineering, and outliers
- An introduction to representation learning
- How to train a clustering model in Azure Machine Learning Studio

## Notes:

### Supervised Learning

#### Regression

Common machine learning algorithms for regression problems include:

- Linear Regression: 

-- Fast training, linear model. 

-- Relation between ****independent values**** and a ****numerical outcome****

-- To measure error: ordinary least sqaures (distance of the predicted value from the value line, minimizes the squared error); and gradiant descent (minimizes the gross error of each prediction)

- Decision Forest Regression: 

-- Accurate, fast training times

-- Combination between multiple decision trees

- Neural Net Regression: 

-- Accurate, long training times

-- Label culomn ****must be numeric**** 


Some of the most common types of classification problems include:

- tabular data: in the form of rows and columns.
- image or sound data: images or sounds whose categories are *already known*.
- text data: texts whose categories are already known.

Machine learning requires ****numerical data.**** This means that with images, sound, and text, several steps need to be performed during the preparation phase to transform the data into numerical vectors that can be accepted by the classification algorithms.

#### Automated Machine Learning (automated training)

Inputing the most frequent value is the default behavior in AutoML to deal with missing values for ****categorical**** features
